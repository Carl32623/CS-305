Software Security

Carl LaLonde

I have included my completed project report for Artemis Financial, a company that needed an evaluation and improvements to the security of their software.  This project allowed me to address aspects of software security within a financial software environment, focusing on implementing secure coding practices and protecting sensitive data.  
Artemis Financial required a vulnerability assessment and strengthening their software security to protect their clients and data against threats.  The main challenge was implementing data encryption into their software.  To meet this need, I successfully identified and addressed security vulnerabilities by integrating code for a dependency check in the pom.xml file.  Software security was also enhanced by implementing AES-256 encryption algorithm paired with SHA-256 hash function.  These standards were chosen for their strong security record for protecting financial information.  Another aspect of securing Artemis Financial’s software and data was the creation of a certificate using Java’s keytool function.  The certificate was fundamental for setting up secure communications.  In doing so, we ensured that any data transferred between the server and client was encrypted and authenticated.  
These secure coding practices can help prevent data breaches which can lead to financial loss as well as damage to client trust.  I learned that input validation and secure authentication are fundamental to protecting against threats such as SQL injection attacks.
